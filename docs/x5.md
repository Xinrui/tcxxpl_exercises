# X.5 A Tour of C++: Containers and Algorithms

1. When first reading this chapter, keep a record of information that was new or surprising to you. Later, use that list to focus your further studies.

2. (∗1) List five standard-library containers.

3. (∗1) List five standard-library algorithms.

4. (∗1) List five standard-library headers.

5. (∗1.5) Write a program that reads a name (a `string`) and an age (an `int`) from the standard input stream `cin`. Then output a message including the name and age to the standard output stream `cout`.

6. (∗1.5) Redo §X.55., storing several (name,age) pairs in a class. Doing the reading and writing using your own `>>` and `<<` operators.

7. (∗2) Initialize a `vector<int>` with the elements `5`, `9`, `−1`, `200`, and `0`. Print it. Sort is, and print it
again.

8. (∗1) Repeat §X.5[7]. with a `vector<string>` initialized with `"Kant"`, `"Plato"`, `"Aristotle"`, `"Kierkegard"`, and `"Hume"`.

9. (∗1) Open a file for writing (as an ofstream) and write a few hundred integers to it.

10. (∗1) Open the file of integers from §X.5[9]. for reading (as an ifstream) and read it.
