# X.23 Run-Time Type Information

1. (∗1) Write a template `ptr_cast` that works like `dynamic_cast`, except that it throws `bad_cast` rather than returning 0.

2. (∗2) Write a program that illustrates the sequence of constructor calls at the state of an object relative to RTTI during construction. Similarly illustrate destruction.

3. (∗3) Consider how `dynamic_cast` might be implemented. Define and implement a `dcast` template that behaves like `dynamic_cast` but relies on functions and data you define only. Make sure that you can add new classes to the system without having to change the definitions of `dcast` or previously-written classes.

4. (∗3) What information would you like to have associated with a class to be accessible at run time? Implement and association scheme as outlined in §22.5.1 as an `unordered_map<type_index,My_info∗>` (§35.5.4). First make a simple version where `My_info` just holds a string associated with the class (e.g., a comment about its purpose). Second, implement a version that does what you want (e.g. holds a table of member function names and pointers to member functions).
