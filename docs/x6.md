# X.6 A Tour of C++: Concurrency and Utilities

1. When first reading this chapter, keep a record of information that was new or surprising to
you. Later, use that list to focus your further studies.

2. (∗1.5) Write a program with two `thread`s: one that writes `hello` every second and one that writes `world!` every second.

3. (∗2) Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., `−O2` or "release"). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.

4. (∗2) Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a `normal_distribution` and `30` rows.

5. (∗1.5) Use a `regex` to find all decimal numbers in a file.
