# X.9 Structures, Unions, and Enumerations

1. (∗1) Define a `struct` with a member of each of the types `bool`, `char`, `int`, `long`, `double`, and `long double`. Order the members so as to get the largest size of the `struct` and the smallest size of the `struct`.

2. (∗1.5) Define a table of the names of months of the year and the number of days in each month. Write out that table. Do this twice; once using an array of `char` for the names and an array for the number of days and once using an array of structures, with each structure holding the name of a month and the number of days in it.

3. (∗1.5) Find an example where it would make sense to use a name in its own initializer.

4. (∗1.5) Define a `struct Date` to keep track of dates. Provide functions that read Dates from input, write Dates to output, and initialize a Date with a date.

5. (∗2) Implement an `enum` called `Season` with enumerators `spring`, `summer`, `autumn`, and `winter`. Define operators `++` and `−−` for Season. Define input `(>>)` and output `(<<)` operations for `Season`, providing string values. Provide a way to control the mapping between `Season` values and their string representations. For example, I might want the strings to reflect the Danish names for the seasons. For further study, see Chapter 39.
