# X.2 The Structure of This Book

The exercises for this chapter focus on the history and philosophy of C++. They mostly aim at an understanding of the rationale behind C++ facilities. Do not attempt these until you have a basic
understanding of C++.

1. (∗1) What does (∗2.5) mean for an exercise?

2. (∗2) Briefly describe the design aims of C++ and comment on the extent to which C++ meets those.

3. (∗4) Write an essay: What can a good programming language do for you and what can’t you expect it to help with?

4. (∗1) What are the main programming styles supported by C++?

5. (∗2.5) List five language features offered by the 1985 version of C++, five features added by C++98, and finally five new features added by C++11. In each case, order the features in
order of importance and for each feature write a sentence describing its role in programming.

6. (∗3) Describe the difference between dynamic (run-time) and static (compile-time) type checking and outline the strengths and weaknesses of each.

7. (∗1.5) List the major components of the C++ standard library.

8. (∗1.5) List five libraries that you would have liked to be part of the standard.

9. (∗1) List three (or more) advantages from having a library as part of the standard.

10. (∗3) List 20 major real-world C++ applications.

11. (∗2) From §1.3 pick five suggestions that to you looks most likely to help improve your programming style.

12. (∗2) Make a "top-ten list" of helpful design and programming rules. Hint: §X.2.
